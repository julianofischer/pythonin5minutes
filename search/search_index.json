Numeric Types There are 3 distinct numeric types : integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. i = 10 # this is a integer number f = 10.258 # this is a floating point number c = complex(2, 3) # this is a complex number -> 2 + 3j Sequence Types There are 4 basic sequence types: string, list, tuple, and range objects. Strings In Python, Strings are arrays os bytes representing unicode characters. Unlike other languages, Python does not have a character data type. A single character is a string with length of 1. Strings are surrounded by single quotes or double quotes. s1 = \"Hello world!\" # double-quoted string s2 = 'Hello world!' # single-quoted string If you are using single quotes surrounding your string, you are able to embed double quotes in your string. s1 = 'Hello \"world\"!' Similarly, if you are using double quotes surrounding your string, you are able to embed single quotes in it. s1 = \"Hello 'world'!\" Lists A list is a collection of things enclosed in [ ] and basically is a heterogeneous dynamic sized array. my_list = [1, 2.3, complex(2,3), \"string\", [\"embedded list\", 1]] As you can see, a single list can contain different data types, including another list . Tuples Tuples are sometimes defined as immutable lists. Unlike lists, tuples are enclosed in ( ) . As well as lists, tuples are also heterogeneous. my_tuple = (1, 2.3, complex(2,3), \"string\") Mappings Mapping types maps hashable (a value that has a hash value that does not change during its entire lifetime) values to arbitrary objects. Currently there is only one standard mapping type in Python, the dictionary. Dictionary A dictionary is the Python implementation of a data structure also known as associative array. Dictionaries are enclosed by { } with a list o key-value pairs separated by a colon. # defining a dictionary d = { \"name\": \"Python\", \"version\": 3.11 } In the above dictionary, \"name\" and \"version\" are keys while \"Python\" and 3.11 are values. Given a key, you can return its respective value from the dictionary: # reading a value from a dictionary d = { \"name\": \"Python\", \"version\": 3.11 } x = d[\"version\"] # x is now 3.11 You can also add a new pair of key-value to a dictionary: d = { \"name\": \"Python\", \"version\": 3.11 } d[\"compliment\"] = \"rocks\" Sets A set is a collection of distinct hashable objects. # creates an empty set s = set() # {} # creates a set with 4 elements s = set(1,\"two\",3,\"four\") # {1,\"two\",3,\"four\"} As well as list and tuples, sets are heterogeneous containers, we can store any hashable value in a set.

The following is the same as x = 18 . x = int(18) # x is now 18 You can also use int() to convert from string values to integer values: x = int(\"18\") # x is now 18 For readability purposes, you can use underscores (_) to group digits: x = 1_000_000_000 # x is 1000000000 An integer has no theoretical maximum limit in python, so, you can have a integer as big as this one: x = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000 # 1 quintillion In practice, the biggest value you can represent in Python will depend on your computer's memory. Floating pointing numbers An floating pointing number (or float) is a number with decimal places. For instance 18 is not a float but 18.1 is.

In the same way, double quote strings allows embedded single quote strings: \"embedded 'single quotes'\" . Trippled quoted strings are also known as raw strings because they can span multiple lines.
